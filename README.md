# LessonOne

This is the first repository for the OpenLessons Project.  OpenLessons 
is a teaching tool. Our audience is both teachers and students and all 
members will be able to provide feedback and rating for their assignments. 
The initial project scope is to create a repository that contains lessons 
and exercises for specific tasks. The goal is to create a collaborative
environment containing cross linked information so that if you 
are either teaching, or teaching yourself, a task you will have 
a shared repository of exercises and lessons that support that specific 
task.

Each Lesson will include:

  The actual text of a lesson
  Links to references
  The skills that are taught in the lesson
  The skills that are needed for the lesson
  Best Practice markers and references
  Suggested move to earlier lessons and next step lessons
  Commentary and edits from the community (moderated)
  
  Exercises that support the lesson (including some that use skills not taught in the lesson)
  
Each Exercise will include:

  An practical exercise description
  A problem that is solved by the exercise
  The skills needed for the exercise
  Links to lessons that teach the skills used
  Sample code that completes the exercise
  Grading rubrics for proficiency level
  
  One or more correct answers
  
Tentative development plan:  
v.01 Includes the framework for the Lesson and related exercises.

v.02 Adds lesson references 

v.03 TBD
